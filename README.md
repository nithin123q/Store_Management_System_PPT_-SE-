# Store_Management_System_PPT_-SE-

We had to study in detail any one of the system for software development for which we selected 
the Store Management System, this excercise was done for our Software Engineering Subject.


After selection of our model we had to present it in detail.
For example why we selected the "V- model" for the Store Management System.

The use of a Use Case Diagram was also necessary for ease of understanding the system.
